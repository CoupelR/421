# 421
421 is a freelance project I realised because I wanted to improve my skills by coding on an unknown language such as SmallBasics.
The idea was to make a based dice game called 421.
The goal of the game is to give all you tokens to the oponent to win the game.
To be able to win you can make differents sequences to overpass the one you oponent did.

The game is actually only player vs player, the IA is not built yet. Also the game can bug if you click too fast on some elements.
